This website contains false, slanderous, and fictitious information about me, my family, and the foundation I hold dear, Keegan’s Promise. What is even more disheartening is that the identity of the person behind this website remains concealed.
</p><p>I want to make it unequivocally clear that I am not an entrepreneur. Instead, I am a retired educator, a devoted mother, a loving wife, and an active member of my community and society. My life revolves around taking care of those I love, engaging in volunteer work, and being a supportive friend. Anyone who genuinely knows me would recognize that the content on this website is nothing but a web of lies.
</p><p>I am exceptionally proud of the work accomplished through Keegan’s Promise. We have organized remarkable fundraisers and raised thousands of dollars to facilitate the adoption of three precious babies into loving families. I established Keegan’s Promise in 2017 when my son Keegan was just 2 1/2 years old, with the primary aim of assisting couples with the significant costs associated with adoption. I poured my time, energy, personal finances, and unrelenting dedication into this foundation, never taking a single dollar for myself.
</p><p>In response to the malicious content on this website, we have engaged legal counsel, Michael Palaagalli with Minc Law to identify the responsible party. The repercussions of this defamation have been profound, negatively impacting my character, reputation, mental well-being, my family, my business, and, most regrettably, Keegan’s Promise, which has been temporarily shut down. 
</p><p>I am a transparent individual, and I invite anyone with questions or those who seek the truth about my character or that of my husband to reach out to me directly. The person who has created this website with the explicit purpose of causing harm to me, my life, and my family is deserving of condemnation.
</p><p>False accusations and slander have no place in a compassionate and just society. I am determined to protect my character and the reputation of Keegan’s Promise and will appreciate the support and understanding of those who stand by me during this trying time.
